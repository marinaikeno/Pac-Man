# Pac-Man

This respository contains my work for the Pac-Man assignment during Web Fundamentals week at Coding Dojo. The purpose of this assignment was to recreate Pac-Man game simply using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to make Pac-Man controllable using keys (up, down, left, right), only move inside the walls, "eat" the dots for 10 points and cherries for 50 points, and to add ghosts that take Pac-Man's life whenever they are both in the same position.
